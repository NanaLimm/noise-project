<h1>Low Impact of Noise on Learning</h1>

<h2>Interpretation of the Result</h2>
<p>
Your results indicate that environmental noise currently has a minimal effect on your learning
process. This suggests a relatively stable ability to maintain concentration despite the presence
of background sounds. However, even when the impact of noise is low, learning efficiency may still
vary depending on task complexity and study duration.
</p>

<h2>Detailed Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain your current study environment, as it appears to support concentration and task engagement.</li>
  <li>Use quiet spaces for cognitively demanding activities such as reading, writing, and analytical tasks.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to subtle changes in focus when background noise increases, especially during long study sessions.</li>
  <li>Take short, structured breaks to prevent mental fatigue and sustain attention over time.</li>
  <li>Ensure appropriate physical conditions (lighting, seating, desk organisation), as these factors interact with auditory conditions.</li>
  <li>Continue monitoring how different environments influence your learning performance, even if difficulties are not immediately noticeable.</li>
</ul>
