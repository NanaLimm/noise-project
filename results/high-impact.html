<h1>High Impact of Noise on Learning</h1>

<h2>Interpretation of the Result</h2>
<p>
Your results indicate a <b>strong negative impact</b> of noise on learning and well-being.
At this level, noise can significantly reduce concentration, increase stress, and cause rapid
mental fatigue. As a result, studying may feel much harder than it should, even when the material
is not extremely difficult.
</p>

<h2>What you may experience</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Frequent distraction and difficulty maintaining attention for more than short periods.</li>
  <li>Strong irritation or tension during study sessions.</li>
  <li>Rapid fatigue, headaches, or a feeling of mental overload in noisy environments.</li>
  <li>A noticeable drop in learning speed, comprehension, and motivation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Use controlled study spaces:</b> choose libraries, quiet rooms, or designated study areas whenever possible.</li>
  <li><b>Apply strong noise protection:</b> active noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs, or both depending on the situation.</li>
  <li><b>Plan study during quiet hours:</b> mornings or times with minimal social/traffic noise.</li>
  <li><b>Reduce additional distractions:</b> disable notifications, avoid multitasking, and keep the desk visually organised.</li>
  <li><b>Use short, structured sessions:</b> 15–25 minutes of work + breaks to prevent cognitive overload.</li>
  <li><b>Separate tasks by intensity:</b> do complex tasks only in quiet conditions; leave simple review tasks for noisier times.</li>
  <li><b>Communicate boundaries:</b> if you share a space, discuss quiet rules or use signals (e.g., “study mode”).</li>
  <li><b>Seek support if needed:</b> if noise consistently harms academic performance or well-being, consider academic support or counselling.</li>
</ul>
